# Matrix _(Animation)_

This is a simple animation of the classic [Matrix code](https://giphy.com/explore/matrix-code) scrolling down the screen.

## Notes

This is my first Javascript project in a while. I'm learning p5.js in order to further supplement future projects.

The code and overall format will get cleaner, I hope.
